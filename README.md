Automated New Gesture Detection, Training, and Motion Classification using SensorTile, Nucleo F303RE board, communicating via Bluetooth to Beaglebone Green Wireless

1. Required libraries: FANN, LiquidDSP
2. Compile: make main
3. Run: ./main (Assuming an existing .net file trained on 4 existing classes exists)
4. All new gesture detection and training-related parameters can be modified in main.h or in train.c
5. See tutorial document for more detailed info on usage.
